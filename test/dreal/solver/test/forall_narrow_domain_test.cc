// H1 (COMPLETENESS — missed refutation → false `delta-sat`): the CE-search query
// is built as DeltaStrengthen(¬(domain → body), ε). Because ¬(domain → body) =
// domain ∧ ¬body and DeltaStrengthen distributes over ∧, the universal-domain
// bound atoms are ALSO ε-tightened. A universal domain narrower than ~2ε — or a
// point domain — is therefore strengthened to the EMPTY set, so the inner solve
// finds no counterexample and the forall is reported satisfied even when it is
// robustly violated. The fix strengthens only the matrix body and keeps the
// universal-domain bounds exact (Kong/Solar-Lezama/Gao CAV-2018).
//
// Each instance below is robustly UNSAT (no δ-model: the existential bound and
// the universal obligation are separated by a margin ≫ δ), so the correct
// verdict is UNSAT. Before the fix the solver returns δ-SAT (the bug); after the
// fix it refutes. These are SOUNDNESS-preserving for the fix (UNSAT was always
// the true answer); the bug was a completeness hole, not a false `unsat`.
