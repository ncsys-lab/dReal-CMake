# PdeCurve

## What it is
The **Taylor-curve data structure** for the PDE solver: "stores a parametric curve together with
first-order derivatives with respect to the initial point" (namespace-page brief). Template
`PdeCurve<SeriesT>`; base class of `PdeSolver`, and the `CurveType`/`SolutionCurve` returned by
`PdeSolver::getCurve()`. It holds, over a time step, the Taylor coefficients of the solution at
the center, of the full set, and of the variational (matrix) blocks, each as series-valued
(tail-bound) coefficients. Derives from `capd::diffAlgebra::CurveInterface<IMatrix>` (confirmed
`PdeCurve.h`).

## Key API (confirmed in `PdeCurve.h`)
- `PdeCurve(size_type dim, size_type order)`.
- Evaluation over the step: `operator()(h)` → series value at time `h` (sums the Taylor series
  of center + Jacobian·δ + remainder); `valueAtCenter(h)`, `remainder(h)`, `getCenter()`.
- Derivatives: `derivative(h)` / `operator[](h)` → finite Jacobian matrix at `h`;
  `oneStepDerivativeOfNumericalMethod(h)`.
- Order/shape: `getOrder()`, `setOrder()`, `getAllocatedOrder()`, `dimension()`,
  `clearCoefficients()`.
- Coefficient access: `centerCoefficient(i,j)`, `coefficient(i,j)`, `coefficient(i,j,k)`,
  `remainderCoefficient(i,j)`; coefficient arrays via `getCoefficients`,
  `getCoefficientsAtCenter`, `getMatrixCoefficients`, `getRemainderCoefficients`, etc.

## dReal status
**Unused — future direction (dReal has no PDE constraints today).** No `src/` reference.

## Why it might matter
This is the PDE analogue of CAPD's ODE `Curve` — and the ODE `Curve` is precisely where dReal's
2026-06 per-slice tube fix came from (`timeDerivative()`,
[curves-and-jets](../../concepts/curves-and-jets.md)). A dReal PDE contractor would evaluate
`PdeCurve` over time sub-intervals to build a tube exactly as the ODE path evaluates `curve(sub)`
today ([dreal-capd-usage.md](../../dreal-capd-usage.md)). Note: the header shows no
`timeDerivative` method on `PdeCurve` (the ODE-`Curve` method dReal relies on for centered-in-time
ranges) — **unverified whether an equivalent exists; confirm in header/`diffAlgebra` base before
assuming the same tube-tightening is available.**
