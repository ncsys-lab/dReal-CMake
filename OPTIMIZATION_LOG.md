# dReal4 Optimization Log (`upgrade-ibex-opts`)

Iterative profile → optimize → benchmark loop. Each idea lands in **Adopted** (committed)
or **Rejected** (with numbers + reason). Acceptance bar: net PAR2 improvement ≈≥10% on the
probe + gate sets, **zero** SAT/UNSAT correctness flips vs ground truth, no >1.5× regressions.
Soundness guardrails (FE_UPWARD/FE_TONEAREST guards, no silent fallbacks) are non-negotiable.

## Measurement setup

- **Baseline:** `benchmark/baseline_local.csv` (~30 stratified, refreshed on this branch).
  The previously-committed local baseline (at `213394110`) was **stale** — it recorded the
  pre-FE_UPWARD-fix false-UNSAT/crash results for `k20/k28/k40 box`; the refreshed one shows
  the correct delta-SAT.
- **Probe set:** `benchmark/probe_odes.tsv` (18 ODE-heavy benchmarks; tacas inverters are the
  most CAPD-sensitive). Own frozen baseline: `benchmark/probe_baseline.csv`. Compare with
  `benchmark/run_probe.sh` → `benchmark/probe_compare.py`.
- **Profiling:** the Release binary (`gcc_build/dreal4`) keeps full function symbols (not
  stripped), so macOS `sample <pid> <secs>` gives function-level attribution with **no**
  separate RelWithDebInfo build needed. (A `prof_build/` RelWithDebInfo dir is only worth
  adding if line-level detail becomes necessary.)
- **Sentinels:** `1mhz_k20/k28/k40 …box…` (the formerly-false-UNSAT trio) are kept in the probe
  set as **soundness sentinels** — if any change re-introduces false-UNSAT they flip to UNSAT.

## Baseline profile (the map we're optimizing against)

`sample` of `tacas_c2e2_0hz_k22_…NOR__sigmoid…SAT` (~112 s baseline, IcpSeq path), 30 s window:

| Frame | % of samples | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `IcpSeq::CheckSat` | 100% | sequential ICP (this benchmark) |
| `contractor_ode_lohner::Prune` | **90.8%** | the ODE contractor is the bottleneck |
| `run_capd_fwd` | 85.4% | forward CAPD integration (BWD contractor is the small remainder) |
| `OdeSolver::encloseC0Map` | 84.5% | |
| `computeTaylorCoefficients` (order 20) | **74.2%** | **primary target** — scales with Taylor order |
| `autodiff::Div::eval` | ~17% | vector-field division AD (inverter sigmoid has `/`) |
| `DoubleRounding::roundUp/roundDown` (leaves) | ~9.3% | per-op FPU-mode switches (CAPD NATIVE intervals) |
| `capd::intervals::operator*` (leaves) | ~6.9% | interval multiplies |

Takeaway: CAPD forward Taylor integration dominates nonlinear-ODE runtime. Highest-value levers
(profiling-justified): **lower Taylor order**, **looser tolerance** (fewer steps), and reducing
the AD operation count. Set type is already `C0Rect2Set` (doubleton + QR reorganization).

## Backlog (ordered; profiling-justified first)

1. Centralize the 3 duplicated CAPD config sites into one helper (refactor; behavior-identical). — prerequisite
2. Lower Taylor order 20 → {16,14,12,10} (sweep). Targets the 74% hotspot directly.
3. Looser tolerance 1e-10 → {1e-9,1e-8,1e-7}. Fewer steps.
4. Joint order×tolerance sweep.
5. Adaptive `n_steps` clamp `[20,60]` / factor `2.0` retune.
6. Set representations: `C0Rect2RSet` / `C0HORect2Set` / tripleton (tightness vs cost).
7. `SolutionCurve` reuse; warm-start step size across ICP iterations.
8. C1/variational backward narrowing (interesting, higher effort).
9. Allocation reduction in `with_params` IMap deep-copy per Prune.
