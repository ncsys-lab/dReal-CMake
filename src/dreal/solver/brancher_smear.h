/// score over the relational constraints. The `SmearVariant` selects one of
/// IBEX's four heuristics along two binary axes — aggregate over constraints
/// by sum vs max, absolute impact |J[i][j]|·diam(box[j]) vs relative
/// (normalized by NC_i = Σ_k |J[i][k]|·diam(box[k])). It assembles an
/// ibex::System once over the *joint* variable set — box (existential)
/// variables first, then any finite-domain ∀-bound (universal) variables —
/// so Jacobian column j maps 1:1 to box dimension j for j < box.size() (no
/// remapping), and universal columns j >= box.size() exist only so the
/// forall-body rows are dimensionally consistent; they are never scored/split.
///
/// A `forall` constraint contributes rows from its body's relational leaves:
/// the universal vars are pinned at their binder intervals (recovered like
/// ContractorIbexForall), so the interval Jacobian's existential columns give
/// each existential variable a sensitivity |∂body/∂x|·diam(x) over the whole
/// universal domain. This is the only constraint-aware signal the *outer*
/// existential branching of an ∃∀ query has (its bounds fold into the box, and
/// the bare forall would otherwise be skipped -> largest-first).
///
/// SOUNDNESS: variable choice can only change how fast the search converges
/// (node count), never a verdict — a completeness/perf lever, never soundness.
/// When the Jacobian is uninformative (all-zero / infinite entries, or no
/// constraints) it falls back to largest-first, matching IBEX's SmearFunction.

/// f_ctrs.jacobian): IcpSeq holds one; IcpParallel builds one per worker.
