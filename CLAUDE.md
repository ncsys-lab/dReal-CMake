- `docs/constraint-order-explanation-soundness.md` — **FIXED SOUNDNESS bug** (2026-06-29): a stiff ODE `integral` logically responsible for a conflict was dropped from `used_constraints_` (CAPD diverges → `contractor_ode_lohner::Prune` returned at its inconclusive exit without recording), so the learned theory clause was built from the satisfiable relational remainder → false `unsat` (triggered by `--constraint-order desc`). Fix: the inconclusive exits call `ContractorStatus::AddInconclusiveOde`, and `GenerateExplanation` splices the ODE in as a non-expanding leaf keyed on the emptying `unsat_witness` (minimal-relevant; witness not the broad closure, which regressed a c2e2 SAT instance to TIM). Validated by no-flip + auditor (2819 lemmas, 0 invalid) + corpus A/B (1.01× PAR2). Adversarial tests: `test/dreal/solver/test/constraint_order_soundness_test.cc`
- `docs/papers/` — foundational Gao et al. literature: companion summaries (δ-decidability/δ-complete/dReal-tool/∃∀) cross-referenced into the docs above, with paper↔code drift flagged (e.g. opensmt+realpaver → CaDiCaL+IBEX+CAPD)

## Project Overview

dReal4 is a delta-complete SMT solver for nonlinear arithmetic over the reals. It takes SMT-LIB2
(`.smt2`) or Delta-Real (`.dr`) formatted formulas and checks satisfiability up to a precision
parameter delta. The `cav26` branch holds pattern-matching/lemma-reuse research; `upgrade-ibex`
(current) source-builds IBEX from the `ncsys-lab/ibex-lib@dreal-perf-patches` fork and uses CAPD
as the sole ODE backend.

---

## Soundness vs. completeness (read before reporting either)

dReal is **sound but δ-complete**; conflating them has cost real experiments here (the hull-grid
"F1" finding was filed as soundness when it was completeness, and got runs cancelled).

- **false `unsat`** (returns `unsat` on a δ-satisfiable φ) = **SOUNDNESS** violation — forbidden.
  Soundness breaks only where a box is narrowed past a true model (wrong FPU rounding, truncated
  ODE feed, strict-bound `nextafter`, scrambled model, underflow).
- **missed refutation / false `delta-sat`** = **COMPLETENESS** violation. Looser enclosures
  weaken this, never soundness.

**Mandate:** whenever you report, label, comment, or commit a soundness/completeness issue —
in chat, code, docs, or commit messages — append the model-theory characterization in parentheses.
Templates: `SOUNDNESS (asserts φ T-unsatisfiable on a T-satisfiable φ — false unsat)`;
`COMPLETENESS (asserts φ^δ T-satisfiable on a T-unsatisfiable φ — missed refutation)`.
Canonical reference: `docs/soundness-vs-completeness.md`. Model-theory depth: the
`smt-model-theory` skill.

## Build

End-user build guide for cloning the repo (prerequisites, native macOS/Linux, Docker):
`README.md`. Build-system configuration for modifying the build (`--version` wiring, CMake
git-version target, IBEX/CAPD source-build): `docs/build.md`.

`./FULL_BUILD.sh` (first build — creates `gcc_build/`) and `./BUILD.sh` (incremental) build
target `dreal4` with `-j8`; binary at `gcc_build/dreal4`. Override IBEX source via
`-DIBEX_GIT_REPOSITORY=file:///path/to/ibex-fork` for local-dev against an unpushed checkout
(`CMakeLists.txt` pins the fork sha `d9930909`).

**Docker** (Linux hermetic verification): after `docker build -f Dockerfile.dreal_ubuntu -t
dreal-linux-verify .`, run `cat query.smt2 | docker run --rm -i dreal-linux-verify ./dreal4 --in
--model`. Bad-fd `-j` caveat: `README.md`.

---

## Running Tests

```bash
cd gcc_build
cmake --build . --target dreal4_cmake_test -j8
ctest                                      # run all tests
./dreal4_cmake_test --gtest_filter="*Box*" # run a single test by name pattern
```

Test sources live under `test/dreal/` mirroring `src/dreal/` structure.

**New test file footgun:** test sources are globbed at configure time (`file(GLOB_RECURSE)`,
no `CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`). A new `.cc` is only picked up after a CMake reconfigure (`cmake gcc_build`
or `FULL_BUILD.sh`). `BUILD.sh` and bare `cmake --build` silently skip new files — the suite
count going up is the tell.

**Rounding-mode gate:** `./rounding_debug_gate.sh` builds the Debug target (`cmake-build-debug`)
and runs the suite; `DREAL_ASSERT_ROUNDING` only fires in Debug. Run it before merges, alongside
`./copy_lint.sh` (incremental clang-tidy copy + UB/perf gate).

**Known flaky tests (ignore — unrelated to solver correctness):** a clean run has only these
failing (the suite total drifts upward as tests are added):
- `IfThenElseEliminatorTest.NestedITEs` and `IfThenElseEliminatorTest.ITEsInForall` — process-global ITE counter causes auxiliary-variable name drift across test registration order
- `Timer.Test1` — timing-threshold assertion fails under load/scheduling jitter

---

## Running the Solver

```bash
./gcc_build/dreal4 --precision 0.001 --produce-models input.smt2
./gcc_build/dreal4 --in --model          # read from stdin
```

Key flags: `--precision <delta>`, `--produce-models`, `--logic <QF_NRA|QF_NRA_ODE>`, `--verbose`.

**Seed-and-verify (`--seed-samples N`, default 64 = ON):** speculative pre-pass for off-center NRA
SAT instances — propose candidate points (multi-start COBYLA) and verify a small box around each via
the existing prune/`EvaluateBox` (soundness/completeness free; gated off for ODE/forall so it never
fires there). `--seed-samples` is also the switch: `0` disables. This replaced the removed 0.56
split-ratio magic + `--explore-order` alternation (split ratio is hardcoded back to 0.5, no flag).
Mechanism + flags: `docs/seeding.md`. Rationale + A/B: `docs/decisions.md` §"Seed-and-verify".
Code: `src/dreal/solver/seed/seed.{h,cc}`.

**Smear branching (`--smear <variant>`, default off):** constraint-aware split-variable choice
(Jacobian-weighted) replacing largest-first; one of IBEX's four `SmearFunction` variants —
`smearsumrel`, `smearsum`, `smearmax`, `smearmaxrel` (required arg; bare `--smear` errors).
Soundness-free (variable choice never moves a verdict). Works in both `IcpSeq` and `IcpParallel`
(`--jobs>1` builds one `SmearBrancher` per worker — the brancher is not thread-safe to share). On
the odeexpr families **`smearsum` is the strongest** (64/72 solved vs 53 off, PAR2 0.03×, 0 flips)
and `smearsumrel` actually regresses v1 — so prefer `--smear smearsum` there. **Forall-body-aware
(2026-07-03):** the Jacobian now includes each `forall` body's existential columns (universal vars
pinned at their binder intervals), so smear is constraint-aware for the ∃∀ `exists_forall`
subfamily's *outer* existential branching (previously inert there → largest-first). Completeness/speed
only — +2 delta-sat solves, `smearsum`≈`smearsumrel` best (here `smearsumrel` does **not** regress),
but branching can't crack the ∃∀ UNSAT enclosure wall. **NRA-only: the full-corpus A/B ruled out a
global default** — smearsum *collapses* the ODE families (saradc 20→1 solved with OOMs; overall
2.03× worse) because the smear Jacobian still skips ODE/`forall_t` (`Kind::ODE_LOHNER`) constraints
(distinct from the ∃∀ `forall`, which it now handles — grep `forall-vs-forall_t`). Enable
per-project for odeexpr only. Mechanism:
`docs/architecture.md` §Branching. A/B: `OPTIMIZATION_LOG.md` §odeexpr. Code:
`src/dreal/solver/brancher_smear.{h,cc}`.

**Forall pre-pruner (`--forall-pre-prune`, default off):** a sound, COMPLETENESS-only IBEX
`ibex::CtcForAll` proj-intersection pre-pruner (`ContractorIbexForall`) that runs *beside* —
never instead of — the δ-complete CEGIS `ContractorForall` in the forall fixpoint, shrinking
the existential box by pure interval contraction (no nested δ-solve). NRA ∃∀ only; works under
`--jobs>1` via a per-worker `ContractorIbexForallMt` cell (one `ibex::CtcForAll` per thread,
keyed on `ThreadPool::get_thread_id()`; mirrors `ContractorIbexFwdbwdMt`). `--forall-pre-prune-prec` (default 0.5) is the
universal-box bisection precision — near-irrelevant on odeexpr_v2 and capped at the
universal-box width above which `CtcForAll` degenerates to a single midpoint check; for an
*unsat* goal it inverts (finer ⇒ stronger refutation). **Encoding-fragile speedup that never
moves the pinned δ=0.0005** — measured record, the SAT-by-construction finding, and the
combine-with-polytope-hurts result: `exists_forall_perf.md`. Mechanism + IBEX-lever
audit: `ibex_docs/AUDIT-QUANTIFIERS.md` Q1. Code:
`src/dreal/contractor/contractor_ibex_forall.{h,cc}`.

**CAPD ODE tuning:** `--ode-taylor-order` (default 12), `--ode-hull-grid` (4 — per-step sub-slice
count; lower widens enclosures (never a false-`unsat`). Since the 2026-06 centered-in-time tube
fix (`HULL_COMPLETENESS.md`) the per-slice range is mean-value-in-time, so the default tube sits
near CAPD precision and hull-grid is no longer a completeness knob; raise to 16+ only for
pathologically sharp invariants),
`--ode-backward` (true), `--ode-abs-tol`/`--ode-rel-tol` (1e-10), `--ode-max-step` (0=adaptive).
Full flag list + performance rationale: `docs/ode-integration.md` §Performance. 2026-06 retuning
campaign: `OPTIMIZATION_LOG.md`.

## Benchmarking

Run `/benchmark` after every meaningful code change. Run proactively at natural breakpoints.

- `/benchmark` — ~8-12 benchmarks, Haiku subagent interprets, 2-4 sentence summary
- `/benchmark-baseline` — full baseline (all odeexpr_v1 + odeexpr_v2 + ~10 each flat family)

**Thresholds:** PAR2 >1.5× baseline = regression; <0.6× = exceptional; SAT↔UNSAT flip = immediate
escalation. CPU time (user+sys), not wall clock.

**Benchmark sources** (two content-addressed `odeexpr_v*` manifest families + three flat dirs):
- `~/Documents/new_dreal/ode_expressivity/benchmarks/` — `odeexpr_v1` family (NRA-only,
  manifest `revisions[].file`)
- `~/Documents/new_dreal/ode_expressivity_energy/benchmarks/` — `odeexpr_v2` family
  (**newest high-priority target**; ∀/∃∀ MLP-expressivity queries in `forall/` + `exists_forall/`,
  manifest `revisions[].smt2`)
- `~/Documents/new_dreal/nraode_to_nra/drealgithub_sunoct5/rolled/` — github_oct5_
- `~/Documents/new_dreal/nraode_to_nra/VNAMSCwI_satoct11/rolled/` — tacas_c2e2_
- `~/Documents/new_dreal/AMS-verification-bundle-of-sticks/saradc/rolled/` — 1mhz_

Full infrastructure (run_batch.sh, select.py, do_ab.sh, do_sweep.sh, families/weighting,
cross-solver comparison): `docs/benchmarking.md`.

---

## Verification discipline

When reporting "tests pass" or "build green," cite the artifact: build dir, commit, or container
image. The trap: ctest reports a pass against `build-old-pin/` (a proven baseline) while the new
build dir is never exercised.

---

## Key Design Notes

**dReal3 backward compatibility is intentional.** The DR parser (`src/dreal/dr/`) handles the
older dReal3 ODE syntax. Don't break this.

**`auditor.cc`** (`src/dreal/solver/auditor.cc`) reprints learned lemmas in dReal3-compatible
format for independent re-checking. Not part of the core solving loop.

**FPU rounding mode:** Read `docs/rounding.md` before touching any interval/ODE/printing code.
The failure mode is a **silent false `unsat`** — wrong ambient mode inverts gaol's directed
rounding with no warning, invisible on exactly-representable constants. Two regimes:
`FE_UPWARD` (gaol/interval → `UpwardRoundingScope`) and `FE_TONEAREST` (CAPD/formatting →
`NearestRoundingScope`). Mode established once per ICP phase, not per contractor call. Two
sanctioned clobberers (`ExpectClobber` tag): CAPD adapters and ibex's interval `operator<<`.

**Source-hygiene lint:** `python3 lint.py` (regex routing) + `./rounding_debug_gate.sh` (lint +
Debug ctest) + `./copy_lint.sh` (clang-tidy copy/UB/perf gate). Key forbidden patterns in
`src/dreal/`: raw `.mid()`/`.diam()` (→ `safe_mid`/`safe_diam`), raw
`ibex::Function::backward` (→ `ibex_hc4_backward`), raw `std::to_string` feeding CAPD (→
`to_capd_string`), interval from scalar `+`/`-` (→ `make_sound_interval`), `arr[i++]`/`arr[++i]`
subscript (BUG-005 scrambled-model class). Full rules: `docs/rounding.md`.

**`filter_assertion` soundness:** strict bound handling had a wrong `nextafter()` call — fixed.
`substitutions_map` forward/backward naming had a soundness bug — fixed. Take care around strict
vs. non-strict inequalities in contractors and the SAT interval logic.

**`forall`-binder shadow guard (QUIRK-001):** a `forall`-bound var whose name collides with a
top-level declared (model) var was silently mis-solved (the unconstrained outer var → spurious
`delta-sat`). The SMT2 driver now throws via `RegisterQuantifiedVariable` on such a collision.
Details: `docs/forall-semantics.md` §4.8.

**ODE feed faithfulness** (`to_capd_string` precision): constants render at 17 sig figs;
`std::to_string`'s 6-digit truncation was a false-`unsat` soundness bug. Details:
`docs/decisions.md` "ODE feed faithfulness" and `docs/ode-integration.md` §Soundness.

**Denormal/underflow soundness** (dreal/dreal4#321): sound in two layers (ibex HC4-backward
`underflow_saturate` + Drake `sound_constant_fold`). Full record + accepted delta-completeness
tradeoff: `docs/decisions.md` "Denormal / underflow soundness".

**ODE performance baseline:** CAPD order-20 was at or below Codac CtcLohner on all tested ODE
benchmarks. The `--capd-t-gate`/`--capd-ndim-gate` flags have been removed (Codac hybrid retired).
Details: `docs/decisions.md` "ODE backend".

**`forall` vs `forall_t` are independent machinery (`forall-vs-forall_t`).** `forall` = the
∃∀ NRA quantifier (`Formula::Forall` → `ContractorForall`, `Kind::FORALL`, CE-guided;
`docs/forall-semantics.md`). `forall_t` = the ODE trajectory invariant (`FormulaKind::ForallT`,
checked per-slice in `contractor_ode_lohner` / `Kind::ODE_LOHNER`;
`docs/qf_nra_ode_semantics.md` §5). Same prefix, unrelated code paths — never swap them. The
docs were confused here once (a mislabeled contractor); grep `forall-vs-forall_t` for the
anchored warnings, and `docs/forall-semantics.md` §7 for the canonical side-by-side.

**Negated/unlinked ODE constraints (BUG-002):** a negated `integral`/`forall_t`, and a `forall_t`
not linked to an integral (invariant must reference the endpoint var `x_t`, not the flow var `x`),
are silently dropped in `link_integral_invariants` — a COMPLETENESS hazard (missed refutation,
never false-`unsat`). This can't be made a throw there (it runs inside DPLL(T) on transient search
literals; throwing crashes valid BMC benchmarks); rejection must be parse-layer (unimplemented).
Desired future semantics is specified as aspirational `GTEST_SKIP` tests in
`test/dreal/smt2/test/dreal_future.cc`. Details: `docs/decisions.md` "Negated / unlinked ODE
constraints", `docs/ode-integration.md`.

**Benchmarking instrumentation:** `std::cerr` prints and JSON dumps exist for benchmarking runs.
`--verbose` (DEBUG) is useful for development; TRACE is deep debugging only.
